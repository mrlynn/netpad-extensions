**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## üí° Suggesting Features

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests as well. When suggesting a feature:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if it's already been suggested
2. **Describe the problem** your feature would solve
3. **Describe the solution** you'd like to see
4. **Consider alternatives** - what other solutions have you considered?

## üîß Contributing Code

### Our Development Process

We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers

### Code Style

- We use ESLint for JavaScript linting
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## üìã Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js Guidelines

- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write JSDoc comments for public functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use async/await instead of callbacks when possible

### Extension Development Guidelines

- Follow VS Code extension best practices
- Handle activation/deactivation properly
- Provide good error messages to users
- Test with different API states (configured/not configured)
- Consider performance impact of operations

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run integration tests with NetPad API
npm run test:integration

# Test extension packaging
npm run package
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality
- Update tests when changing existing functionality
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include integration tests for API interactions

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- Keep README.md up to date
- Document new configuration options
- Include examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md for releases

### JSDoc Standards

```javascript
/**
 * Analyzes the provided code using NetPad API
 * @param {string} code - The code to analyze
 * @param {string} language - Programming language of the code
 * @param {string} [analysisType='summary'] - Type of analysis to perform
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Analysis results from NetPad
 * @throws {Error} When API request fails
 */
async function analyzeCode(code, language, analysisType = 'summary') {
    // Implementation
}
```
